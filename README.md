I’m Siyuan Lu, a **junior Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence**, with a current focus on:
- **LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):** Improving agent collaboration in large-scale systems.
- **Self-Evolving Agents:** Exploring how agents can continuously reorganize and adapt themselves.

🔭 **My long-term research goal:**
Based on a well-modeled world model of the physical world 🌍, build a self-evolving agent system 🤖 which can continuously receive multi-modal feedback 📄🎨🎥 (e.g., text, audio, images, video, 3D data) from the world 🌏 and adapt to the changing environment 🌟.
